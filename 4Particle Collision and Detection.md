### LHC and Particle Collision

Particle physics takes the simplest possible approach to study the most fundamental pieces of our universe: smashing things together and seeing what happens. TThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC), an enormous circular tube of 27km circumference filled with superconducting magnets, was constructed by more than 10000 scientists and engineers solely to make infinitesimally small particles move spectacularly quickly and collide with each other. Circular particle accelerators consists of electric cavities that accelerate charged particles and magnets that maintain the circular orbit of these particles. A particle’s speed dramatically increases as it revolves inside the tube. A particle’s speed dramatically increases as it revolves inside the tube. For example, a proton in the LHC can be accelerated to 0.999999991 times the speed of light. This is only 3 meter per second slower than light speed! Then scientists shoot bunches of these extremely fast particles into each other. When they collide, interesting things can happen.

In most proton collisions the quarks and gluons inside the two protons interact to form a wide array of ordinary particles. Occasionally particles of light are produced, or energetic particles paired with their anti-particles.  Very occasionally, these collisions produce new particles for us to find. It had previously been known that the world is made of atoms, an atom consists of protons and neutrons, and they consist of up-quarks and down-quarks. However, by colliding particles at high energies, scientists found many other new particles, such as top-quarks, bottom and charm-quarks, and W & Z bosons. The faster the particles are, the higher energy they obtain, opening up the possibility to produce previously unknown phenomena. Most recently, the Higgs boson, which holds the secret of the origin of mass, is discovered at the LHC. 
The goal of colliding particles is to answer questions such as what is all matter made of, and what creates the interactions of matter, in the most fundamental level. By discovering new particles and phenomenon we can find answers to these questions.


### ATLAS and Particle Detection

After a particle collision, particles such as electrons, photons, muons, and hadron jets shoot out to every directions. Energy of these particles is measured by a device called calorimeter. A calorimeter is usually metal plates that absorb the particle’s energy and measure it with sensors. ATLAS, the particle detector of LHC, consists of several layers of calorimeters. ATLAS uses liquid Argon instead of metal plate in its calorimeters.

The stream of particles first goes through the electromagnetic calorimeter, which measures the energy of electrons and photons. Then the particles enter the hadronic calorimeter. Hadrons, particles made of quarks bound by strong force, deposit all their energy here. The next layer is muon spectrometer, which measures the energy of muons. Neutrino passes every layer, so its energy cannot be measured by calorimeter.

By analyzing the trajectories and energies of the particle, we can calculate the dynamics of the collision and search for new particles. After repeating thousands of collisions, a statistically significant (about 5~6 sigma) result can be obtained about the existence of a new particle. This is how the Higgs particle was discovered in ATLAS in 2013.
