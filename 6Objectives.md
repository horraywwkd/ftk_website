### Test the function of Fast TracKer Data Formatter (DF) boards.

In the Fast TracKer system, the Data Formatter (DF) boards take the crucial role of arranging the data into specific conical regions. The DF boards quickly process enormous amount of data and sort out only the relevant fraction of it. This significantly facilitates the process of reconstructing the partricle tracks.

The DF boards are manufactured in Waseda University, Japan. We receive the boards and test their functions; particularly, we check whether there are any unstable or disconnected links in the board. After a sophisticated test the boards are finally sent to CERN.

A test consists of four procedures: 1. Visual Inspection 2. LED Blink Test 3. RTM (Rear Transition Module) Test 4. Backplane Test. Particularly the RTM test and the backplane test is done by IBERT (Integrated Bit Error Ratio Test) and Eye Scan test. A link should not make errors more than once in 1e13 bits, and should maintain stability in large enough variations of time and voltage. 

### Modeling g -> bb and calibrating b-quark identification tools

Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b and anti-b quarks has the most probability to happen among all the possible means of Higgs decay. To find Higgs in this decay mode, we usually rely on finding its daughter b quarks with neural net based algorithms and combining the four vectors of the b quarks to reconstruct the Higgs boson. When the Higgs boson carries large amount of momentum, the problem becomes difficult. Its daughter b quarks (and their subsequent decay products) tend to be collimated in their direction of flight and end up depositing energy in a small region on the calorimeter. The conventional tools of Higgs identification may lose power due to the proximity of the two b quarks.
 
Novel b quark identification methods and techniques that can estimate the number of hadrons depositing energy in small regions on the calorimeter are developed to help better reconstruction of Higgs boson. The performance of such tools, however, needs to be understood well before we apply them. An environment very similar to high momentum h->bb is gluon splitting to bb, which is also a large but not so well modeled background to h->bb. Our group works on correcting the modeling of this process and calibrating the new tools in this environment.
