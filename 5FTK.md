As the LHC reaches new energy extremes during its 14 TeV run, the physicists who work to interpret its data face new challenges. FTK - or Fast TracKer - is a hardware system that helps to combat these challenges by more quickly synthesizing data as it comes off detectors at the Atlas experiment and by identifying in a more sophisticated way what that data represents before passing it downstream to the next step in the Atlas data chain.

An important example of this data-identification is the FTK’s ability to identify B jets, which are the signature mark of one of the heaviest fundamental particles: the bottom or beauty quark. Both current physics in need of experimental confirmation and exciting, untested physics predict the production of this type of particle, making its isolation from the ‘noise’ coming off of the Atlas detectors absolutely crucial.

The FTK system is comprised of several sub-systems with unique functions. The Data Formatter (DF) intakes data and arranges it into conical regions associated with a single particle or decay, then passes it on to the associative memory, which does the work of reconstructing the particle tracks and identifying some relevant tracks. From there, data is sent out of the FTK system by the FTK-to-Level 2-Interface-Crate, or FLIC.
